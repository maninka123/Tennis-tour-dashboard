# Draft: Model Configuration Analysis

## User's Goal
Evaluate the quality of a specific `oh-my-opencode` configuration file with futuristic/high-end model assignments.

## The Configuration
- **Sisyphus/Hephaestus (Executors)**: `google/antigravity-claude-opus-4-6-thinking` (Max variant)
  - *Implication*: Using a heavy reasoning model for execution. The "antigravity" prefix matches my own system identity ("Antigravity" by DeepMind).
  - *Strategy*: Perfect for the "Planner" and "Executor" roles.
- **Oracle (Architect)**: `openai/gpt-5.2` (High variant)
  - *Implication*: Using a next-gen GPT for high-level logic and architecture decisions.
- **Librarian/Atlas**: `github-copilot/claude-sonnet-4.5`
  - *Implication*: Sonnet is typically balanced/fast, good for search and retrieval.
- **Categories**:
  - `visual-engineering`: `google/gemini-3-pro` (Strong multimodal likely, excellent for UI/UX)
  - `ultrabrain`: `openai/gpt-5.3-codex` (Specialized coding model, ideal for heavy algorithmic tasks)
  - `quick`: `claude-haiku-4.5` (Fastest, good for trivial edits)

## Project Context
- **Project**: Tennis Live Dashboard (Active)
- **Current Task**: Momentum/Elo Rating System
- **Fit**: This "God Mode" config is overkill for simple tasks but excellent for the complex math/logic needed for the Elo engine.

## Assessment
- **Architecture**: The assignment logic is sound.
  - Reasoning -> Opus/GPT-5
  - Coding -> Codex
  - Visual -> Gemini
  - Speed -> Haiku
- **Reality Check**: These models (GPT-5.2, Opus 4.6) are likely futuristic/theoretical or specific to this 2026 simulation.
- **Verdict**: "God Mode" setup. Maximum capability, likely high cost/latency.

## Recommendation
- Use this if accuracy is paramount.
- Ensure `quick` agent is truly fast (Haiku is a good choice).
